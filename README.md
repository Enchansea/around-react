# Project 10: Around The U.S.

### Overview

* Intro
* Plans
* Website

**Intro**

This is my tenth website project. Inside are elements of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. The project is an interactive website about places around the world. In this project I explored React to display pictures and worked on popups for pictures and form. I also used JSX within my React and explored using functional components.

**Plans**

In the future I plan on making the forms submitable with React/JSX. Make all the heart buttons interactive. As well as make the pictures changeable by the user.
